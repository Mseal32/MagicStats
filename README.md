# MagicStats:
## Overview
Have you ever wondered how great you must be when compared to your friends? Escpically in a card game such as Magic? This tool gives you the opportunity to prove just that. Powered (almost entirely) by Dearpygui and one lone trooper of a .json file, you'll be seeing stats and numbers in place of supposed-to-be-fun house games in no time! And just to give you a taste of what you can do: even if you aren't a chad developer like myself, you'll have near full control over the JSON data in the software, being able to edit the Games Played, Games Won, and Games Lost of each deck. You are able to view the stats of each deck, as well as how you (or your friends) are doing on a player basis! In other words, you can view how many games you've played, how many you've lost, and you can despair over your horrendously low winrate! You can compare player stats against other players, and I almost forgot to mention the LEADERBOARDS!
